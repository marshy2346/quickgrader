QuickGrader v1.0

Instructions:

(1) Go to python script directory
(2) Add driver file to directory
(3) Add expected output text file to directory
(4) Add optional input file to directory
(5) Record all names in config.py
(6) In same directory, run python3 main.py

The script will run the diff on each student's assignment
(compare expected output and program output).

After, the script will prompt you to add a comment.

have to be modified in order for the program to be helpful.

All comments will be in comments.csv file
All folders with errors will be recorded in errors.txt
